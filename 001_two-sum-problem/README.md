# Problem Definition

➜ Given an array of integers <br>
➜ Given an integer target value <br>
➜ Return the indices of the 2 numbers that add up to that given target<br>

# Example

➜ [1, 3, 7, 9, 2], target = 11 <br>
➜ result should be = (3, 4) <br>

# Constraints

➜ All numbers are positive <br>
➜ There are no duplicates numbers in the array <br>
➜ There my not always be a solution for the problem <br>
➜ We can recieve an empty array <br>
➜ If there is no solution return null (depends on the language you use) <br>
➜ Only one pair of numbers will be the solution, in other means we can't have more than one solution

# Test cases

```bash
[5], target = 5
➜ result = null
```

```bash
[1, 2, 4, 9], target = 13
➜ result =  [2, 3]
```

```bash
[], target = 8
➜ result = null
```
